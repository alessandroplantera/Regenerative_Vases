# 🌍 ReGenerative Vases

**ReGenerative Vases** is a design research project that explores place-based regeneration by combining **generative computational processes** with **sustainable materials** sourced from local quarry waste.

This repository contains the code and visual assets for the **official landing page** of the project, as well as elements of its **digital visual identity**.

## ✨ Concept

ReGenerative Vases aims to transform discarded materials—marbles and rocks from Ticinese quarries—into beautifully crafted vases that embody the **geological and cultural richness** of their origin.

Using advanced digital fabrication techniques such as **large-scale 3D printing**, the vases are shaped by algorithms inspired by **natural geological layering**, resulting in a fusion of nature and technology.

At the core of the concept is the principle of **form following process**: just as stratification leaves visible marks on rocks, the digital fabrication process leaves unique traces on the printed objects. These traces celebrate the **material history** and the **technological method** of their construction.

This experimental approach embraces **re-generative design**—not just generating new forms, but giving **new life to discarded resources**. The series of three vases, designed for outdoor use, act as prototypes for a potential scalable product line that promotes sustainable design practices.

The project includes a **web platform for generative co-design**, allowing users to customize material and shape parameters. This interactive experience will culminate in an **installation at Milan Design Week**, emphasizing the link between **digital creation** and **physical making**.

> 🧡 _The project is supported by Ikea Foundation Switzerland._

## 🖥️ About the Landing Page

This repository contains the **landing page** developed to communicate the project online. It serves as a digital showcase to:

- Introduce the concept and values of ReGenerative Vases
- Present photos and visuals of the final objects
- Communicate the sustainability-driven approach and fabrication process

The **visual identity** incorporates datamoshing as a metaphor for destruction and re-creation—reflecting the project's emphasis on **evolution**, **material transformation**, and **the generative beauty of process**.
